# Basic Chess engine to train new players
### Approximately 400~500 ELO

A simple chess engine project to demonstrate an understanding of algorithms and algorithm design

The chess engine includes move highlighting, animation and the option to play as either black or white or two players can play against each other.

*The engine works with the help of a few common algorithms such as Min-Max, NegaMax and alpha beta pruning with recursion, which was used to remove moves that wouldn't work in the given situation, optimising the engine and making it far more efficient*

The chess engine accounts for each move that the opponent takes and will try and find the ideal move based on the algorithms used and a points system, 1-8 for pawns and 1-4 for all of the other pieces excluding the King. A larger score means a better position but the engine won't always move/capture, it will still evaluate to find a better move.
